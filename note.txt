MONGO DB QUERIES:

Best apraoch for finding unique data to use findOne() instead of find() beacause 
in findOne() when it is found it will not search for another and when it is  not found it will returns null
so that you can response that accordingly however
in find()  when it is found it will search for another and when it is  not found it will returns empty object
in findById it is better the findOne when you only find the data by id
